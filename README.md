- 👋 Hi, I’m Ariane. I am Postdoc at the University of Konstanz
- 👀 I am a sociologist interested in Life Course, Inequality and Welfare Policies
- 🌱 I'm already an advanced user of Stata, but I am always curious to extend my knowledge on models for complex data (panel, multilevel, experimental) and I'd like to improve my R skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the topics mentioned above
